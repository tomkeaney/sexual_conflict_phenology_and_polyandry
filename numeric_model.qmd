title: "The numeric model"

## General points

- We assume continuous time, where emergence, mating and death can occur at any real value of _t_ within a generation. 

- _Kawanaphila nartee_ has an annual lifecycle, where offspring eclose in early spring and all adults die in the summer, making generations discrete. 

- Fitness is the cumulative number of offspring that survive to breeding age in the next generation (think on this).

- Densities of females and males vary continuously

- The model considers a temporally varying resource that determines reproductive success from mating at a specific time. 

- We assume that males can become sperm depleted. 

## Lifecycle

- Coevolving traits $T_F$ and $T_M$ for female and male emergence/development times (these are quantitative characters).

- Available individuals form mating pairs using mass-action law (closer term to our field is fertilisation kinetics).
