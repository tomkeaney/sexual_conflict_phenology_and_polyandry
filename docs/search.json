    "text": "17/10/23\n\nThe West Australian Bush cricket\nLeigh will send through some info on the lifecycle / other relevant stuff like sperm precedence etc.\nThey are sperm mixers, with a little bit of second male precedence (I think)\nResources become available as pollen during the brief flowering season. Heat waves at the end of this period result in very high mortality for adults, but eggs can survive in diapause.\nFemales are polyandrous, but the extent to which they are depends on resource availability.\nIf resources are abundant, then females become less interested in mating and sexual selection is stronger in males than females.\nIf resources are scarce, females depend upon the male spermatophore for nutrition. Males can only produce one spermatophore every 5-10 days, so they quickly become a limiting resource. Females therefore compete vigorously for males and sexual selection potentially becomes female-biased.\nThis is relevant for protandry because it determines reproductive success in both sexes, but in a way that depends upon resource availability. It is therefore a really nice system to test the models predictions with manipulative experiments.\nProtandry can be viewed in terms of the length of development. This may be plastic and reflective of the resource availability conditions.\ni.e. if you make resources scarce, then females should plastically shorten their development, whereas if resources are abundant, females should match development with male availability and resource availability.\nI need more info on the above to make the prediction clear."
