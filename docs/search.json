    "text": "Males often arrive early, and this has fitness benefits - early monopolisation of females, the chance to mate throughout the mating season etc.\nFemales might not want to arrive so early because they don’t have to mate so much, mating a lot might be bad, or they want to time arrival/emergence with resource availability for their offspring.\nBut if males keep arriving earlier, selection begins to favour earlier arrival in females as well, because the risk of going unmated grows larger.\nThis can start a runaway process of earlier and earlier emergence for both sexes. In typical interlocus conflict fashion, males harm females as a biproduct of male-male competition for fertilisations. Absolute female fitness decreases because they evolve to emerge/arrive further from the resource peak.\nThe runaway process is eventually stopped when female arrival gets too far away from the resource peak.\nThe result is sexual conflict load, where females are potentially not optimally adapted on either front (finding mates or enjoying lots of resources).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe current model only considers females that can be inseminated once. What happens if there is polyandry?\nMy first thoughts are: females will deplete male sperm stores more rapidly, which might increase the rate of matelessness and select females that arrive earlier. This pushes emergence time further still from the resource. However, now there is sperm competition. If there is last male precedence, then perhaps selection on males to arrive earlier is abated. This is potentially good for the population because the arms race does not drive arrival time as far away from the resource as previously found."

    "text": "17/10/23\n\nThe West Australian Bush cricket\nLeigh will send through some info on the lifecycle / other relevant stuff like sperm precedence etc.\nThey are sperm mixers, with a little bit of second male precedence (I think)\nResources become available as pollen during the brief flowering season. Heat waves at the end of this period result in very high mortality for adults, but eggs can survive in diapause.\nFemales are polyandrous, but the extent to which they are depends on resource availability.\nIf resources are abundant, then females become less interested in mating and sexual selection is stronger in males than females.\nIf resources are scarce, females depend upon the male spermatophore for nutrition. Males can only produce one spermatophore every 5-10 days, so they quickly become a limiting resource. Females therefore compete vigorously for males and sexual selection potentially becomes female-biased.\nThis is relevant for protandry because it determines reproductive success in both sexes, but in a way that depends upon resource availability. It is therefore a really nice system to test the models predictions with manipulative experiments.\nProtandry can be viewed in terms of the length of development. This may be plastic and reflective of the resource availability conditions.\ni.e. if you make resources scarce, then females should plastically shorten their development, whereas if resources are abundant, females should match development with male availability and resource availability.\nI need more info on the above to make the prediction clear."
