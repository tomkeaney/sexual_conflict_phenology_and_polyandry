    "text": "17/10/23\n\nThe West Australian Bush cricket\nLeigh will send through some info on the lifecycle / other relevant stuff like sperm precedence etc.\nThey are sperm mixers, with a little bit of second male precedence (I think)\nResources become available as pollen during the brief flowering season. Heat waves at the end of this period result in very high mortality for adults, but eggs can survive in diapause.\nFemales are polyandrous, but the extent to which they are depends on resource availability.\nIf resources are abundant, then females become less interested in mating and sexual selection is stronger in males than females.\nIf resources are scarce, females depend upon the male spermatophore for nutrition. Males can only produce one spermatophore every 5-10 days, so they quickly become a limiting resource. Females therefore compete vigorously for males and sexual selection potentially becomes female-biased.\nThis is relevant for protandry because it determines reproductive success in both sexes, but in a way that depends upon resource availability. It is therefore a really nice system to test the models predictions with manipulative experiments.\nProtandry can be viewed in terms of the length of development. This may be plastic and reflective of the resource availability conditions.\ni.e. if you make resources scarce, then females should plastically shorten their development, whereas if resources are abundant, females should match development with male availability and resource availability.\nI need more info on the above to make the prediction clear."

    "text": "General points\n\nWe assume continuous time, where emergence, mating and death can occur at any real value of t within a generation.\nKawanaphila nartee has an annual lifecycle, where offspring eclose in early spring and all adults die in the summer, making generations discrete.\nFitness is the cumulative number of offspring that survive to breeding age in the next generation (think on this).\nDensities of females and males vary continuously\nThe model considers a temporally and/or spatially varying resource that determines reproductive success from mating at a specific time. For example, females entering the mating pool just as grass trees flower have plenty of resources and high fecundity. Those females entering the mating pool during the kangaroo paw flowering have less resources and lower fecundity. The same argument extends to whether females mature on kangaroo paws or grass trees. But this isn’t a timing problem so we can put it to one side for now.\nMales can become sperm/spermatophore depleted. The amount of time they spend replenishing their spermatophore depends on local resource abundance. Males grow their spermatophores to a max size (which individually varies and has proxies which females use to choose/ focus their competition potential mating partners).\nThe numeric model can be solved to find the hypothetical timing traits that maximise population fitness or the solutions predicted to occur when the sexes coevolve."

    "text": "Lifecycle\n\nCoevolving traits \\(T_F\\) and \\(T_M\\) for female and male emergence/development times (these are quantitative characters - genotypic values).\nAvailable individuals form mating pairs using mass-action law (closer term to our field is fertilisation kinetics). That is, the population-wide rate of mating pairs forming at any t is proportional to the product of male and female densities at time t, multiplied with a constant v that characterises male search efficiency.\nIndividuals are available as mates if they have emerged, are alive and not in time-out. For males, time-out is determined by the length of time taken to replenish their spermatophore. For females, time-out is determined by… (some reading required). Each indirectly depends on the abundance of resources available immediately following mating.\n\nEmergence\nIndividuals with Trait value with \\(T_F\\) or \\(T_M\\) display an emergence distribution governed by the equations\n\\[E_F(t, T_F) = \\frac{e^{t-T_F}}{(1 + e^{t - T_F})^2}\\]\n\\[E_M(t, T_M) = \\frac{e^{t-T_M}}{(1 + e^{t - T_M})^2}\\]\nfollowing Zonnevald and Metz (1991) and Ekrem and Kokko (2023).\n\\(E_F(t, T_F)\\) and \\(E_M(t, T_M)\\) are the numbers of females and males emerging at time t.\nI understand how equations work a lot better after plotting them. For some values of t and \\(T_i\\) let’s see what this function looks like.\n\n\nCode\n  expand_grid(t = seq(from = -8, to = 8, by = 0.01),\n              T_i = rnorm(50)) %&gt;% \n  mutate(Emergence = exp(t - T_i)/(1 + exp(t - T_i))^2) %&gt;% \n  \n  ggplot(aes(x = t, y = Emergence)) +\n  geom_line(aes(group = T_i, colour = T_i)) +\n  labs(y = \"Prop. individuals emerging/arriving\",\n       x = \"Time, t\",\n       colour = \"Timing trait value\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\nTracking mating and death\n\nMating dynamics are followed over one breeding season at a time. The sexes encounter one another with search efficiency \\(v\\), where higher values indicate efficient mate finding. Males die with rate \\(\\mu_M\\) and females with rate \\(\\mu_F\\).\nEkrem and Kokko (2023) consider a population where a male can become sperm-limited. Should be use a similar approach? Sperm-limitation and the constraints imposed by the spermatophore are separate processes producing mate limitation for females. Whether sperm-limitation ever matters in this species is a matter for debate."
