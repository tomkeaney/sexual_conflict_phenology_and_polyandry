    "text": "17/10/23\n\nThe West Australian Bush cricket\nLeigh will send through some info on the lifecycle / other relevant stuff like sperm precedence etc.\nThey are sperm mixers, with a little bit of second male precedence (I think)\nResources become available as pollen during the brief flowering season. Heat waves at the end of this period result in very high mortality for adults, but eggs can survive in diapause.\nFemales are polyandrous, but the extent to which they are depends on resource availability.\nIf resources are abundant, then females become less interested in mating and sexual selection is stronger in males than females.\nIf resources are scarce, females depend upon the male spermatophore for nutrition. Males can only produce one spermatophore every 5-10 days, so they quickly become a limiting resource. Females therefore compete vigorously for males and sexual selection potentially becomes female-biased.\nThis is relevant for protandry because it determines reproductive success in both sexes, but in a way that depends upon resource availability. It is therefore a really nice system to test the models predictions with manipulative experiments.\nProtandry can be viewed in terms of the length of development. This may be plastic and reflective of the resource availability conditions.\ni.e. if you make resources scarce, then females should plastically shorten their development, whereas if resources are abundant, females should match development with male availability and resource availability.\nI need more info on the above to make the prediction clear."

For example, females entering the mating pool just as grass trees flower have plenty of resources and high fecundity. Those females entering the mating pool during the kangaroo paw flowering have less resources and lower fecundity. The same argument extends to whether females mature on kangaroo paws or grass trees. But this isn’t a timing problem so we can put it to one side for now.\nMales can become sperm/spermatophore depleted. The amount of time they spend replenishing their spermatophore depends on local resource abundance. Males grow their spermatophores to a max size (which individually varies and has proxies which females use to choose/ focus their competition potential mating partners).\nThe numeric model can be solved to find the hypothetical timing traits that maximise population fitness or the solutions predicted to occur when the sexes coevolve."

    "text": "Lifecycle\n\nCoevolving traits \\(T_F\\) and \\(T_M\\) for female and male emergence/development times (these are quantitative characters - genotypic values).\nAvailable individuals form mating pairs using mass-action law (closer term to our field is fertilisation kinetics). That is, the population-wide rate of mating pairs forming at any t is proportional to the product of male and female densities at time t, multiplied with a constant v that characterises male search efficiency.\nIndividuals are available as mates if they have emerged, are alive and not in time-out. For males, time-out is determined by the length of time taken to replenish their spermatophore. For females, time-out is determined by… (some reading required). Each indirectly depends on the abundance of resources available immediately following mating.\n\n\nEmergence\nIndividuals with trait values \\(T_F\\) or \\(T_M\\) display an emergence distribution governed by the equations\n\\[E_F(t, T_F) = \\frac{e^{t-T_F}}{(1 + e^{t - T_F})^2}\\]\n\\[E_M(t, T_M) = \\frac{e^{t-T_M}}{(1 + e^{t - T_M})^2}\\]\nfollowing Zonnevald and Metz (1991) and Ekrem and Kokko (2023).\n\\(E_F(t, T_F)\\) and \\(E_M(t, T_M)\\) are the numbers of females and males emerging at time t.\nI understand how equations work a lot better after plotting them. For some values of t and \\(T_i\\) let’s see what this function looks like.\n\n\nCode\n  expand_grid(t = seq(from = -8, to = 8, by = 0.01),\n              T_i = runif(50, min = -2, max = 2)) %&gt;% \n  mutate(Emergence = exp(t - T_i)/(1 + exp(t - T_i))^2) %&gt;% \n  \n  ggplot(aes(x = t, y = Emergence)) +\n  geom_line(aes(group = T_i, colour = T_i)) +\n  labs(y = \"Prop. individuals emerging/arriving\",\n       x = \"Time, t\",\n       colour = \"Timing trait value\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTracking mating and death\n\nMating dynamics are followed over one breeding season at a time. The sexes encounter one another with search efficiency \\(v\\), where higher values indicate efficient mate finding. Males die with rate \\(\\mu_M\\) and females with rate \\(\\mu_F\\).\nEkrem and Kokko (2023) consider a population where a male can become sperm-limited. Should we use a similar approach? Sperm-limitation (imposes sexual selection on females) and the constraints imposed by the spermatophore (imposes natural selection on females) are separate processes producing mate limitation for females. Whether sperm-limitation ever matters in this species is a matter for debate.\n\nHere, I rewrite the equations that describe the population to accommodate a time-in, time-out mating framework. Individuals arrive in the time-in state and once mated move to the time-out state. The sexes then have specific rates at which they transition back into the mating pool. We start by considering a simple case, where females gain no direct benefits from mating i.e. once-mated and multiple mated females are not distinguished.\n\\[\\frac{df_0}{dt} = -vm_0(t)f_0(t) - \\mu_Ff_0(t) + \\delta_Ff_1(t) +  E_F(t, T_F)\\]\n\\[\\frac{df_1}{dt} = vm_0(t)f_0(t) - \\mu_Ff_1(t) - \\delta_Ff_1(t)\\]\n\\[\\frac{dm_0}{dt} = -vm_0(t)f_0(t) - \\mu_Mm_0(t) + \\delta_Mm_1(t) + E_M(t, T_M)\\]\n\\[\\frac{dm_1}{dt} = vm_0(t)f_0(t) - \\mu_Mm_1(t) - \\delta_Mm_1(t)\\]\nHowever, female K. nartee get large direct benefits from consuming the spermatophore, resulting in increased fecundity. Females that have mated multiple times might therefore be better considered as a distinct class from those that have mated once. The situation is made additionally complex because the fitness benefits associated with spermatophore consumption are moderated by local resource abundance. When resources are plentiful, females become reluctant to mate, whereas there is intrasexual competition among females for male spermatophores when resources are scarce.\nSome equation work here"

    "text": "Reproductive success\n\nTemporally defined seasons\n\nResources become available as some time before \\(t = 0\\), resource abundance peaks at \\(t = 0\\) and resources decline thereafter.\n\nFollowing Ekrem and Kokko (2023), we model reproductive success, \\(R(t)\\), using the same functional form for the environment as for the emergence time distributions defined above. We write reproductive success as\n\\[R(t) = \\frac{400e^{t/L}}{(1 + e^{t/L})^2}\\] where \\(L\\) is the length of the season. When \\(L\\) is small, reproductive success declines quickly as the temporal mismatch with the resource peak increases. The 400 value is simply an aesthetic inclusion, producing a reproductive output of 100 when the temporal mismatch = 0. It has no affect on the evolutionary outcome, which depends on relative reproductive success.\n\n\nCode\n  expand_grid(t = seq(from = -10, to = 10, by = 0.01),\n              L = runif(10, 0, 2)) %&gt;% \n  mutate(`Reproductive output` = 400*exp(t / L)/(1 + exp(t / L))^2) %&gt;% \n  \n  ggplot(aes(x = t, y = `Reproductive output`)) +\n  geom_line(aes(group = L, colour = L)) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(-10, 10)) +\n  labs(y = \"Reproductive output\",\n       x = \"Time, t\",\n       colour = \"Length of season\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContext dependent spermatophore importance\nHowever, \\(R(t)\\) is also affected by the number of spermatophores a female consumes. With this in mind, reproductive success can be rewritten as not sure I’ve got the notation of S correct\n\\[R(t, S) = \\frac{400e^{t/L}}{(1 + e^{t/L})^2} + S(t)n\\] where \\(S(t)\\) describes the importance of spermatophores at a resource at time \\(t\\) and \\(n\\) is the number of spermatophores ingested by the female (essentially a Bateman gradient).\n\\[S(t) = \\alpha(100 - \\frac{400e^{t/L}}{(1 + e^{t/L})^2})\\] The \\(\\alpha\\) parameter controls the magnitude of fecundity increase attributed to the spermatophore, relative to resources available via other paths. If \\(\\alpha = 1\\) (note this is unrealistically large), each spermatophore consumed when no other resources are available provides the same benefit to fecundity as does timing reproduction perfectly with the temporal resource peak. The second term in the equation moderates the Bateman gradient such that the effect of resource availability on fecundity negatively correlates with the effect of spermatophore consumption on fecundity. When \\(t = 0\\) this second term equals zero i.e. there are no fecundity benefits from spermatophore ingestion.\nWhen \\(n = 1\\) spermatophore ingestion raises the fecundity floor:\n\n\nCode\n  expand_grid(t = seq(from = -10, to = 10, by = 0.01),\n              L = runif(10, 0, 2),\n              a = seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = 0.1)) %&gt;% \n  mutate(`Reproductive output` = 400*exp(t / L)/(1 + exp(t / L))^2 +\n           (a * (100 - (400*exp(t / L)/(1 + exp(t / L))^2)))) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = t, y = `Reproductive output`)) +\n  geom_line(aes(group = L, colour = L)) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(-10, 10)) +\n  facet_wrap(~a) +\n  labs(y = \"Reproductive output\",\n       x = \"Time, t\",\n       colour = \"Length of season\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\nOf course, we assume that both sexes can enter the mating pool at a time completely disassociated with resource availability. It may not be realistic to assume males can produce spermatophores when there are no floral resources."
